# Time-Series-Analysis

The "Time-Series-Analysis" project involves applying two distinct models on different datasets:

1. SARIMA Model with Indonesian Inflation Data:
   Utilizing the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model to analyze and forecast inflation trends in Indonesia. SARIMA is adept at handling time series data with seasonal patterns, making it suitable for analyzing economic indicators like inflation. By leveraging historical inflation data, this model aims to forecast future inflation rates, which can assist in making informed economic decisions.

3. GARCH Model with IBM Stock Data:
   Implementing the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model on IBM stock data. GARCH models are proficient in capturing volatility clustering and fluctuations in financial time series. By analyzing historical stock data, particularly IBM's, this model intends to forecast and manage the volatility and risk associated with the stock's returns. This analysis aids investors in understanding potential risks and optimizing portfolio management strategies.
